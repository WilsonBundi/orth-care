# 📸 Add Your Medical Images

## Quick Start

I've set up the landing page to use your 6 medical images. Here's how to add them:

### Step 1: Rename Your Images

Rename your 6 images to these exact names:

1. **doctor-consultation.jpg** - Doctor with patient/consultation image
2. **medical-facility.jpg** - Doctor with stethoscope image  
3. **digital-health.jpg** - Medical injection/treatment image
4. **joint-pain.jpg** - Ankle/foot pain illustration (blue/red)
5. **knee-pain.jpg** - Running figure with knee pain (blue)
6. **shoulder-pain.jpg** - Shoulder/elbow pain illustration (blue/red)

### Step 2: Copy Images

Copy all 6 renamed images to this folder:
```
public/images/
```

### Step 3: View Results

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000
