# Professional Landing Page Redesign Plan

## Goal
Create a clean, professional healthcare landing page with proper image and text separation.

## Key Design Principles (Healthcare Industry Standards)

### 1. Layout Structure
- Clean header with logo and navigation
- Hero section with clear call-to-action
- Feature sections with alternating image/text layout
- Service cards in grid format
- Footer with contact information

### 2. Image Treatment
- Images should be properly sized and contained
- No text overlapping images
- Consistent aspect ratios
- Professional spacing between elements
- Subtle shadows for depth

### 3. Typography
- Clear hierarchy (headings, subheadings, body)
- Readable font sizes (16px minimum for body)
- Proper line spacing (1.5-1.75)
- Professional font families (Inter, Roboto, etc.)

### 4. Color Scheme
- Primary: Professional blue (#667eea)
- Text: Dark gray (#1a202c, #4a5568)
- Background: Light gray/white (#f8f9fa, #ffffff)
- Accents: Success green for checkmarks

### 5. Spacing
- Generous whitespace
- Consistent padding (40-60px sections)
- Clear visual separation between sections
- Breathing room around all elements

## Recommended Approach

Would you like me to:

1. **Create a modern healthcare landing page** with:
   - Side-by-side image/text sections (desktop)
   - Stacked layout (mobile)
   - Professional card-based services
   - Clean, minimal design

2. **Or provide specific guidance** on what elements from SHA you'd like to incorporate (without copying their design)?

Please let me know which approach you prefer, and I'll implement it professionally.
